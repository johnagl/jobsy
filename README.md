# Shortlist

## Project Description
- #### Who is it for?
  - Shortlist is for job seekers who want to keep track of their job applications and progress with their job search.

- #### What does it do?

They will be able to add and update specific job information such as which stage a particular job application is in (Not yet applied, applied, phone screen, on site interview etc). Users also can keep track on interview dates for each job with an in-app calender and manage documents related to their job search.
 
- #### What type of data does Shortlist store?
  - Job application information inputted by the user. This includes company name, position title, calendar dates and deadlines, and relevant documents.
  
- #### What are users be able to do with this data?
  - Users can easily visualize their progress and keep track of their various applications in an easy to navigate all-in-one platform.
  
- #### What is some additional functionality do we want to add in the future?
