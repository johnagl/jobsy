# Jobsy

## Project Description
- #### Who is it for?
  - Jobsy is for job seekers who want to keep track of their applications/progress with their job search.

- #### What will it do? 
  - Users will have the ability to track the details of all of their job applications without having to use cluttered spread sheets and/or a complicated local file folder system. They will be able to update specific job information such as which stage a particular job is, in the application process (Not yet applied, applied, phone screen, on site interview etc). An additional feature we are hoping to add is a metrics section where the user can visualize a number of statistics (average number of jobs applied for in 1 week, number of jobs at different stages of the application process etc). 
 
- #### What type of data will it store?
  - Test 3
  
- #### What will users be able to do with this data?
  - Test 4
  
- #### What is some additional functionality you can add/remove based on time constraints?
  - Test 5
