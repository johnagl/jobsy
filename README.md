## Description
- #### Who is it for?
  - Shortlist is for job seekers who want to keep track of their job applications and progress with their job search.

- #### What does it do? 
  - Users have the ability to track the details of all of their job applications without having to use cluttered spread sheets and/or a complicated local file folder system. They will be able to add and update specific job information such as which stage a particular job application is in (Not yet applied, applied, phone screen, on site interview etc). Users also can keep track on interview dates for each job with an in-app calender and manage documents related to their job search.
